Both justify-items and justify-self are properties that control the horizontal alignment of grid items within their grid cells, but they operate at different levels. Here's an explanation of the difference between them:


-justify-items:
justify-items is a property that is applied to the container (the grid itself) and controls the default horizontal alignment of all grid items within the grid.It sets the alignment for all grid items at once.

example:
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  justify-items: center; /* All grid items will be centered horizontally */
}

.grid-item {
  /* The horizontal alignment of grid items will be centered by default */
}


-justify-self:
justify-self is a property that is applied to individual grid items, and it allows you to override the horizontal alignment of a specific grid item within its cell. It sets the alignment for a specific grid item, which can be different from the default set by justify-items.

Example:
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  justify-items: center; /* All grid items will be centered horizontally */
}

.grid-item {
  justify-self: start; /* This specific grid item will align to the start of its cell */
}
