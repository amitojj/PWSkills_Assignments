Main difference between CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid is that the CSS Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a one-dimensional layout model that's designed for arranging items within a container along a single axis, either horizontally or vertically, But CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout model that allows you to create both rows and columns, making it ideal for creating complex, grid-based designs.
Flexbox is  best suited for tasks like aligning items in a row or column, centering content, or creating equal-height columns. Flexbox excels at distributing space within the container and is often used for building flexible and responsive layouts within a single dimension.
Grid is suitable for structuring the layout of entire web pages or applications. Grid can handle complex two-dimensional layouts with ease, making it a powerful tool for responsive and grid-based design.
